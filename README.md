# Word-Level Text Generation using LSTM

**Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras  
**GitHub URL:** [Project Link](#)

---

## Overview
This project focuses on **word-level text generation** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** in an unsupervised learning setup. The goal is to generate coherent and meaningful text by learning sequential patterns and contextual relationships from raw textual data.

---

## Workflow
- **Data Preparation:**  
  - Raw text file used as the dataset.  
  - Text cleaned, tokenized, and split into sequences of words.  
  - Each sequence structured so that a group of preceding words predicts the next word.

- **Model Architecture:**  
  - Implemented an **LSTM network** to capture sequential dependencies.  
  - Trained on word sequences to learn contextual relationships and language patterns.

- **Text Generation:**  
  - The trained model predicts the next word in a sequence, allowing generation of coherent text.  
  - Demonstrates the ability to capture syntax, semantics, and style from the training data.

## Key Features
- Word-level language modeling and prediction.  
- Sequential data handling and preprocessing.  
- LSTM-based architecture for natural language generation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Deepened understanding of **sequential modeling** and **contextual learning**.  
- Hands-on experience in **data preprocessing for text generation**.  
- Gained practical skills in **LSTM networks** and **natural language generation techniques**.
